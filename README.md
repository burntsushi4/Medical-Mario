# Medical-Mario | 2D Unity Platformer
------

Medical Mario is a 2D platformer game I developed in Unity using the C# language. Additionally, I also hand drew most of the art and visuals.

The Covid-19 vaccine has ran away, and it's up to Dr. Mario to retrieve it. Traverse the different levels in hopes of finally finding it, but beware the traps!
